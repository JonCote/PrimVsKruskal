# PrimVsKruskal
Function that will run prims and Kruskals algorithm side by side checking if the MST developed by dataset are equal
If at any point the early detection system detects a divergence in the MST's formed the function will return false

Function was designed as a solution to an assigned problem set expressed in the PrimVsKruskalAssignment PDF given in CSC226 Algorithms and Data structures II at UVIC using the algs4 library
